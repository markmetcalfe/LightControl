# LightControl

A lightbulb that can be remotely controlled online, with the ability to see it change live!

## Background

In 2016, I had a nice little project idea: creating my very own sunrise alarm clock. I was struggling getting up in the cold winter mornings, and I decided to create a lightbulb that would gradually get brighter and brighter as it got closer to when I needed to wake up. This would simulate a sunrise, gradually waking you up rather than having a loud, stressful alarm.

I decided to pivot away from this idea however, as I no longer required waking up at ungodly hours of the morning. I didn't want to abandon the project however, as I had already set up infrastructure for changing the lightbulb state online. I pivoted to it simply serving the purpose of controlling a lightbulb remotley online.

## Usage
To get it up and running, simply run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will launch Light Control in your browser, ready to go!
